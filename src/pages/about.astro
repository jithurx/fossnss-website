      <h2>Who we are 🤔</h2>
      <p>
        The FOSSNSS (FOSS Cell) of NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad is a collective of students who like to explore and spread the open-source software and its ideology. Roots of this FOSS Cell dates back to the year 2009. The cell focuses on contributing to Free and Open Source Software, advocating for free software and mentoring students to achieve excellence in various fields, leading the whole campus to the world of Freedom, Community and Free Software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team has been constantly working for the promotion of free and open source technology tools, developing software that respects users' freedom. We try our best to bring an inclusive culture in campus for having strong discussions about open source, latest technology, and anything that falls under freedom!
