      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        This is a placeholder 'About' page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can edit this file (`src/pages/about.astro`) to add information
        about the FOSS cell, its history, mission, and members.
      </p>
      <p>
        The styles you see here are applied automatically by the 
        `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin (the `prose` class in `PostLayout.astro`, 
        though this page doesn't use that layout, we use the `prose` class directly).
      </p>
