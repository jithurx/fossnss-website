 He also gave an introduction to git and github, explained how we can collaborate with other OS developers by forking their code provided in github and innovating it. He shared his idea on how to build an effective coding environment in the public providing opportunities and also a kickstart for beginners in this field.

He also explained the working of FLOSSBANK and how we could install it in our system.
 Later he did a small talk on Teacher's Fund and explained how we could contribute to the same. He then gave us a live hands on session on how we could open a spam free pull request and how to fork a code to github.
