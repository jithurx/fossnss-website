There were many misconceptions and doubts in the field of open source, this session became a complete answer to all those.

 Mr. Allen started by building basic knowledge on opensource. Many of us were totally unaware of the scope of opensource in the present world. The speaker pointed out the presence of open source softwares in our day to day life and the situations in which we come accross them.

Open source includes source codes which is made freely available for modification and redistribution. He also included the advantages of opensource over other softwares. Open source softwares are cheaper and user-friendly.
