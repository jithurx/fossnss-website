It has been 2 years since the official inauguration of **FOSS NSSCE** and it was time to welcome new members into the family. 

An orientation program is planning for the 1st year students of NSSCE to give them a brief intro to the world of FOSS. The main agenda of the program is to give the students a clear idea of what FOSS stands for and to eradicate the common misconceptions regarding FOSS.
